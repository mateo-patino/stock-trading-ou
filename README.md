# Stock trading with the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process ðŸ“ˆ
This repository contains code for a mean-reversion trading algorithm based on the [Ornstein-Uhlenbeck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ornsteinâ€“Uhlenbeck_process) (OU) process. The scripts in this repository are meant to illustrate the implementation of such an algorithm and should not be used to inform real investment decisions.

## Installation
This code requires [Python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and certain external libraries ("dependencies") to run. First, make sure you have Python3 installed in your system. Then, install the dependencies by running 
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
There are two executale scripts in this repository, `mean_reversion.py` and `market_performance.py`. 

`mean_reversion.py` reads a list of companies, checks them for mean-reverting behavior, fits an OU process to their price series, and prints a list of companies whose stock can be potentially bought or shorted. This script outputs recommended portfolio allocations for each company too. This program takes four command-line arguments: the file name containing the company list, a start date and end date for the look back period in the format `yyyy-mm-dd`, and a threshold for the [Augmented Dickey-Fuller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augmented_Dickeyâ€“Fuller_test) test, which filters out non-mean reverting companies from the original list. For example, consider the command

```
python3 mean_reversion.py companies.in 2023-01-01 2024-12-31 0.05
```
which reads a list of companies from `companies.in`, selects the daily close prices of these companies from January 1, 2023 to December 31, 2024, and uses p < 0.05 to identify companies whose prices don't exhibit mean-reverting behavior.

`market_performance.py` reads a list of companies and their portfolio allocations and plots the performance of the portfolio against the S&P 500 and NASDAQ over a number of years. It takes four command-line arguments: the file name containing a list of companies and the percentage of each one within a portfolio, a start and end date for the lookback period in the format `yyyy-mm-dd`, and an amount of starting capital. For example, running
```
python3 market_performance.py portfolio.in 2020-06-01 2024-12-01 10000
```
creates a plot of the performance of the portfolio in `portfolion.in` from June 1, 2020 to December 1, 2024 against the NASDAQ and S&P 500 with a starting capital of $10,000. This program does not support intra-year lookback periods, meaning the start and end dates must have different years.

## Input formats

For `mean_reversion.py` and `market_performance.py` to run properly, they expect inputs in specific formats. 

`mean_reversion.py` expects a file where each line contians a stock symbol and the name of the corresponding company separated by whitespace (`companies.in` illustrates this format). 

`market_performance.py` expects a file where each line contains a stock symbol, the name of the company, and the company's percentage in the portfolio (take a look at `portfolio.in` for an example).
